# Contribution

If you have found a problem, and you do not have the ability or desire to change the source code,
just create a new issue.

If you want to change the source code, participation in the project implies following
some very simple rules:

* Fork this repository to your own account;
* Make your changes and make sure the verification is passed;
Verification includes the execution of unit testing, as well as checking by a static code analyzer.
We use [Qulice](https://www.qulice.com/) as such an analyzer;
* If you are changing the API or complement DSL syntax, be sure to describe these changes
in the documentation (at least, fix README.md);
* Commit your work and push to a new branch on your fork;
* Submit a pull request with an understandable title.
If needed, add a description or (and) link to an issue;
* Participate in the code review process by responding to feedback.
